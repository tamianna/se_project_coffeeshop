# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

One thing I thought of that would help add personalization to the coffee shop website is by
adding a `review` section. Which should also have an option to submit customer photos.

- _Allows_ customers to express themselves
- Gives _potential_ customers a chance to check it before coming in.
- _Boost_ internet ratings
